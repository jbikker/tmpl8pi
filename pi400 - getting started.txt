 WARNING - SETTING UP THE PI4 IS FINICKY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
and postpone any clever changes to a later stage, i.e. UNTIL AFTER
 YOU GOT THE BASICS WORKING. *Pain is the inevitable alternative.*

!! These instructions are for the pi4 and pi400. These are equivalent.
!! It doesn't matter how much memory your pi4 has.

For a new SD card:

1. Get Raspberry Pi OS manager for windows: https://www.raspberrypi.org/software
2. Use it to put the default 64-bit recommended Raspberry OS on a micro sd card.
   Make sure you reset any custom settings back to default.
3. First boot:
   - Put the sd card in your pi4 or pi400.
   - Connect a mouse, a keyboard and a monitor.
   - Connect power last. This boots the pi4. There is no power switch sadly.
   - Connect it to wifi, and if it wants, let it update.
4. Click the Raspberry icon in the top-left of the screen, 
   go to 'Preferences', then to 'Raspberry Pi Configuration', 'Interfaces', 
   and enable 'SSH' and 'VNC' if they are not set already.
   Under 'Performance', set GPU mem to 128.
5. Go into the console (black icon at the top of the screen) and type:
   sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
   sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev
   sudo apt-get install g++ gdb make ninja-build rsync zip
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt full-upgrade
   This installs the software and libraries you need for this block.
6. Turn off the screensaver via:
   sudo raspi-config
7. Optionally, a pi400 can be overclocked. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS RISKY!!
   Info via https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=304534:
   sudo nano /boot/config.txt, change:
   dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d to dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d or vc4-kms-v3d-pi4
   replace #arm_freq=800 by:
   force_turbo=1
   over_voltage=8
   arm_freq=2200
8. Optionally, flash an updated kernel. DO THIS ONLY ONCE, i.e. NOT WEEKLY: 
   sudo rpi-update, for a flash update.
9. Connecting Visual Studio to the pi400:
   - Goto Tools->Options->Cross Platform->Connection Manager
   - Verify in Configuration Properties->Debugging; set ip to default.
 
Profiling:

See https://www.softwarecoven.com/software-profiling-tools-for-raspberry-pi .
1. use gprof: compile and link with -pg, and temporarily disable 'Omit Frame Pointer'
2. ./piwrld.out â€“mode=execute gprof ./pw
3. gprof -b -p ./piwrld.out
   gprof -b -p -l ./piwrld.out
